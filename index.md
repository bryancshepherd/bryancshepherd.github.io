# Welcome!

Yes, our lights have a webpage! Why? I don't know. But since we're all here, here's a little additional information.

## Equipment
- ### Are these a special type of lights?
-- Yes! The programmable lights aren't the same kind you get at Home Depot, Target, etc. They are a special type of light designed for light shows. Each light has separate channels corresponding to different colors that can be controlled independently.

- ### What equipment, other than the lights, is required?
-- In addition to the lights you need:
-- **1. Software to build/design the sequences (the patterns of lights)** 
--- This show was built in xLights. It is open source and is one of the top two or three most popular programs used by non-professionals. 
-- **2. Software to schedule and run the sequences**
--- The current setup uses Falcon Player (abbreviated FPP for some reason) running on a raspberry Pi.
-- **3. A device that maps the software outputs to the individual lights**
--- This is called a controller. The controller for this year's show is an AlphaPix 4
-- **4. Software to translate the xLights sequences into something the controller can understand**
--- FPP and the raspberry Pi handle this, as well.

- ### How long does it take to program a sequence?
-- This is my first year so there was a lot for me to learn. It took quite a long time to program just the couple of song you hear in the show. Now that I know how to do it I am a little faster, but I don't think it will ever take less than 4-5 hours to do a 3-4 minute song. 

- ### How long did it take to set everything up?
- I literally started in January of 2020 and worked off and on throughout the year. (I was motivated by guilt since we went out of town last year and didn't put up any lights.) COVID-19 slowed things down a little bit, but there was so much to learn, figure out and build, that it's fair to say it took a good 6 months of time.

## Other resources
- If you would like to learn more about programmable light shows, here are some of the resources I've found really helpful:
-- https://learnchristmaslighting.com/ - A Christmas Lighting website by a lighting professional. It covers all of the basics very well. 
-- https://xlights.org/ - xLights is the sequencing program I used. Their forums on their website are a very good resource.
